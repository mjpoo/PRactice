# PRactice
An extremely basic project to allow students practice in creating issues, branching, pull requests and code reviews.

## Github Page
The contents of the `docs` folder are being used as a dist for the https://mjpoo.github.io/PRactice/ site. This uses these [Actions](https://github.com/mjpoo/PRactice/actions/).

## Master Branch
A public repo has been set up at https://github.com/mjpoo/PRactice.
This is the main home of the project

## Collaborators
Any Github user can submit and issue or a PR so this is the approach we will use.
Collaborators are not required for this project, indeed it sort of defeats the idea of having to request a PR if they can just go ahead and edit the main branch.

## Issues
Anyone can add an issue to the project.
Issues will appear at https://github.com/mjpoo/PRactice/issues.

Step 1 = The student should either create an issue for a feature they think the site should have or respond to an open issue saying they wish to tackle it. Top tip = include `@mjpoo` in the comment to attract his attention.

Step 2 = Mjpoo will reply in the issue saying they are happy for the student to go ahead with the change.

## Forking and Editing
Step 3 = The student should create a new fork of the [main branch](https://github.com/mjpoo/PRactice) in their own Github account (e.g. https://github.com/studentname/PRactice)
Step 4 = The student clones the fork to their local machine (e.g. in VS Code).
Step 5 = The student edits it there and commits it to their branch.
Optional Step = Would be useful for the student to view their change at https://studentname.github.io/PRactice/

## Pull Requests (PRs)
Step 6 = When the student is happy with the change they submit a PR by using "Compare & Pull Request".

Step 7 = When Mjpoo has tested the change he'll merge it with the main branch.

## Code Review
It would be nice to also practice code reviews in this exercise although that will mean complicating it slightly by adding collaborators.

## VS Code Extensions
There is no need to install the new (GitHub Repositories)[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=github.remotehub] extension into VS Code. This exercise will work using the source control feature (which requires a local version of the repo unlike the new GitHub extension which does not).
